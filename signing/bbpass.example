#    https://developer.blackberry.com/codesigning/
# 2. Fill in:
#    CNNAME: the Common Name for your signing cert
#    KEYSTOREPASS: CSK password you entered in step 1 signup
#    BBPIN: target device's PIN
#    BBPASS: target device's password
# Important: any symbols need to be escaped according to bash / Makefile rules
